# How to prepare for a math (or stem?) degree at a top University?
Mathematics students. We are very diverse, from those interested in Pure Mathematics, through those focusing on Statistics all the way to Applied Mathematicians, we come from different countries and continents, UK, Eastern Europe, Asia and more; but the one thing we have in common is our passion for that subject and the very similar way we got hooked on maths.
Not during math classes, but after them when working on extra problem sets that would prepare us for our first competitions. From there we picked up on Olympiads, small research projects, took part in summer math camps and by the time we were to take entry exams – we were somewhat prepared.

- **Top Universities** - Wether it's Cambridge or Oxford, MIT or Stanford, IVY League school or ETH Zurich or another top University you want to get in, it will require a lot of passion and determination to prepare yourself for application. You will have to impress the interviewer in an oral examination, get top grades at your A-levels (or equivalent) and get required grade at the entry exam. The process sounds very stressful and impossible to succeed at, but if you start your jourey with mathematics that require problem solving and creativity early enough - you will enjoy it!

# How will you be tought? How Can I help you?

I tutor highschool and middle school students interested in taking part in olympiad competitions and studying undergraduate mathematics or applying for STEM undergraduate degrees, whether it's physics, engineering or computer science, math will still be very important!

Since highschool I was preparing students for Junior Math Olympiads [that’s how it worked in my school back in Poland, I was tought by my older peers, to give back the favour, I would conduct extra classes for my younger peers] and through that journey I gathered a lot of study materials and a lot of materials have been also created. Some of the materials I have co-authored where sourced by the Olympiad Committee and published as official studying source.

Lesson consists of content lectured by me with theorem and ideas presented. Then I give carefully selected problem set with questions in that subject. The student then goes through the questions in his own time [most important part of learning!] and then we discuss their questions and solutions. Hints are available for questions and can be shared between lessons if needed.

Although I will help you with preparation for your entry exams and guide you through application process I don't specialise in the last minute crash courses. Instead I will help you understand what mathematics is really about, help you become creative and come up with outside of box thinking over longer period of time and develop mathematical skills that will become very usefull whether you decide to pursue mathematical olympiads, mathematical degree or any other STEM degree.

# About me.
I am a part III masters of mathematics student at Cambridge University and I have been through the journey described above, I have taken part in Polish Math Olympiads and become a Laurate numerous times and as a reward I got the opportunity to represent Poland in St Petersburg, Slovakia and Vietnam. My research project [link here] took part in EUCYS and Delta, I took part in PROMYS 2019 and PROMYS 2020, as well as MBL 2018 and MBL 2020. During my undergraduate degree I have done summer projects in Graph Theory (2022) and Logic - Finite Model Theory (2023). This year I will be specializing in Logic and Set Theory which is universal for all pure mathematics with a prospect to undertake a PhD course in that field.

# Entry exams

- The **SAT** Math is a section of the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) used for college admissions in the U.S. It evaluates students' mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities. The topics covered include algebra, data analysis, advanced algebraic concepts, and additional math topics. Scores range from 200 to 800 and provide colleges with insights into a student's math readiness for higher education.
- The **Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT)** is a standardized test used by the University of Oxford as part of the admissions process for undergraduate courses in mathematics and related disciplines. The MAT assesses students' mathematical skills, problem-solving abilities, and aptitude for higher-level mathematical thinking. It consists of challenging and thought-provoking questions that require creative problem-solving and a deep understanding of mathematical concepts. The MAT aims to identify candidates who have the potential to excel in rigorous mathematical studies at the university level.
- The **Sixth Term Examination Paper (STEP)** is a series of mathematics exams used by the University of Cambridge as a requirement for admission to study mathematics and related subjects at the undergraduate level. STEP assessments are designed to challenge students with complex, non-routine mathematical problems that go beyond standard curriculum topics. These exams assess a student's ability to think critically, apply advanced mathematical concepts, and formulate creative solutions. STEP scores provide insights into a candidate's readiness for the rigorous mathematical studies offered at the University of Cambridge and other top institutions.
- The **Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA)** is a specialized mathematics test used by certain universities in the United Kingdom, including the University of Cambridge and the University of Warwick, for admissions to mathematics and related courses. The TMUA is designed to assess a student's mathematical thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to work with complex and unfamiliar mathematical concepts.

TMUA scores offer universities valuable insights into a student's aptitude for advanced mathematical studies and their potential to succeed in challenging academic environments.

# Application Process

- A **personal statement** for undergraduate applications is a concise written document where applicants showcase their motivations, experiences, and qualifications for their chosen academic program. It provides insights into the applicant's background, interests, and aspirations, highlighting how they align with the chosen course of study. The personal statement allows candidates to express their unique qualities, demonstrate their passion for the subject, and explain why they are a suitable candidate for admission. Its purpose is to provide admissions committees with a more comprehensive view of the applicant beyond their academic achievements and test scores.
- A **reference letter** is a written endorsement provided by an individual who can speak to an applicant's qualifications, character, and abilities. Typically, these letters are requested as part of an application process, such as for jobs, scholarships, or educational programs. Reference letters offer insights into the applicant's work ethic, skills, accomplishments, and potential contributions. They serve as external endorsements that provide credibility and additional perspective to support the applicant's candidacy.

- Oral interviews in person are face-to-face interactions where individuals are evaluated through verbal communication. Often used in various contexts, such as job interviews, admissions processes, or research assessments, oral interviews assess candidates' communication skills, critical thinking, and ability to articulate thoughts clearly. During the interview, candidates respond to questions posed by interviewers, elaborating on their qualifications, experiences, and viewpoints. These interviews provide a dynamic platform for assessing both technical knowledge and personal qualities, allowing interviewers to gauge a candidate's suitability beyond what's visible on paper.
