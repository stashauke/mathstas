# How to prepare for math Olympiads?
# How to prepare for STEP exam in advance?
# How to prepare for a math degree at a top University?
# How to prepare for a STEM degree at a top University?

From my experience the best advice I could give to a school student asking themselves one of the above question would be to enjoy mathematics and develop passion for that subject. But that's easier said then done. Math when presented at school rarely struck exciting, so how can you be passionate about it? Here with help comes a range of extracurricular activities:

# Extracurricular activities

- **Maths competitions** - Math competitions are a great place to get started if you want to explore engaging mathematics.
 
    Read more: Kangaroo Math Competition, Junior / Intermediate / Senior Mathematical Challenge, AMC 8 / AMC 10 (American Mathematics Competitions 8 / 10)

- **Olympiads** - To take part in olympiads you have to stretch you mathematical out-side of the box thinking, as questions are no longer closed form. You need to write down your solution which usually is an abstract proof, which may be intimidating at the beginning but highly addictive after a while.

- **Research projects** - To undertake a research project you have to unleash your true unlimited creativity, a paper has to be written on a subject not studied before, not only do you have to solve a hard problem, but you have to find one first! Once accepted a poster or a presentation will be necessary for the finals.

- **Camps** - If that’s not enough for you and you want to spend your summer doing maths, apply for one of those. You will get to meet peers as excited about maths as you from other countries!

- **Private Tutoring** - Another good way to explore maths is through one to one tutoring!


# How will you be tought? How Can I help you?

I tutor highschool and middle school students interested in taking part in olympiad competitions and studying undergraduate mathematics or applying for STEM undergraduate degrees, whether it's physics, engineering or computer science, math will still be very important!

Since highschool I was preparing students for Junior Math Olympiads [that’s how it worked in my school back in Poland, I was tought by my older peers, to give back the favour, I would conduct extra classes for my younger peers] and through that journey I gathered a lot of study materials and a lot of materials have been also created. Some of the materials I have co-authored where sourced by the Olympiad Committee and published as official studying source.

Lesson consists of content lectured by me with theorem and ideas presented. Then I give carefully selected problem set with questions in that subject. The student then goes through the questions in his own time [most important part of learning!] and then we discuss their questions and solutions. Hints are available for questions and can be shared between lessons if needed.

Although I will help you with preparation for your entry exams and guide you through application process I don't specialise in the last minute crash courses. Instead I will help you understand what mathematics is really about, help you become creative and come up with outside of box thinking over longer period of time and develop mathematical skills that will become very usefull whether you decide to pursue mathematical olympiads, mathematical degree or any other STEM degree.

# About me.
I am a part III masters of mathematics student at Cambridge University and I have been through the journey described above, I have taken part in Polish Math Olympiads and become a Laurate numerous times and as a reward I got the opportunity to represent Poland in St Petersburg, Slovakia and Vietnam. My research project [link here] took part in EUCYS and Delta, I took part in PROMYS 2019 and PROMYS 2020, as well as MBL 2018 and MBL 2020. During my undergraduate degree I have done summer projects in Graph Theory (2022) and Logic - Finite Model Theory (2023). This year I will be specializing in Logic and Set Theory which is universal for all pure mathematics with a prospect to undertake a PhD course in that field.
