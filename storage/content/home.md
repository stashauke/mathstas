- How to prepare for math Olympiads?
- How to prepare for STEP exam in advance?
- How to prepare for a math degree at a top University?
- How to prepare for a STEM degree at a top University?

From my experience the best advice I could give to a school student asking themselves one of the above question would be to enjoy mathematics and develop passion for that subject. But that's easier said then done. Math at school is aimed at the avererage student, so how can you be passionate about it? If you want and need to be better you need to do more than just what is in school. A good piece of advice I once read was if you want to really lern a subject you always have to read and study more than is in the curriculum for the year you are learning. Here with help comes a range of extracurricular activities:

# Extracurricular activities

- **Maths competitions** - Math competitions are a great place to get started if you want to explore engaging mathematics.
 
    Read more: Kangaroo Math Competition, Junior / Intermediate / Senior Mathematical Challenge, AMC 8 / AMC 10 (American Mathematics Competitions 8 / 10)

- **Olympiads** - To take part in olympiads you have to stretch you mathematical out-side of the box thinking, as questions are no longer closed form. You need to write down your solution which usually is an abstract proof, which may be intimidating at the beginning but highly addictive after a while.

    Read more: British Mathematical Olympiad, International Mathematical Olympiad, USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO), USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO)

- **Research projects** - To undertake a research project you have to unleash your true unlimited creativity, a paper has to be written on a subject not studied before, not only do you have to solve a hard problem, but you have to find one first! Once accepted a poster or a presentation will be necessary for the finals.

    Read more: - European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS), Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)

- **Camps** - If that’s not enough for you and you want to spend your summer doing maths, apply for one of those. You will get to meet peers as excited about maths as you from other countries!

    Read more: Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists (PROMYS), MathCamp, Math Beyond Limits (MBL)

- **Private Tutoring** - Another good way to explore maths is through one to one tutoring!


# How will you be taught? How Can I help you?

I tutor highschool and middle school students interested in taking part in olympiad competitions and studying undergraduate mathematics or applying for STEM undergraduate degrees, whether it's physics, engineering or computer science, math will still be very important! A good grade in maths is the best way for University Admission to assess students ability to think logically and solve problems.

Since highschool I was preparing students for Junior Math Olympiads [that’s how it worked in my school back in Poland, I was tought by my older peers, to give back the favour, I would conduct extra classes for my younger peers] and through that journey I gathered a lot of study materials and a lot of materials have been also created. Some of the materials I have co-authored where sourced by the Olympiad Committee and published as official studying source.

Lesson consists of content lectured by me with theorem and ideas presented. Then I give carefully selected problem set with questions in that subject. The student then goes through the questions in his own time [most important part of learning!] and then we discuss their questions and solutions. Hints are available for questions and can be shared between lessons if needed.

Although I will help you with preparation for your entry exams and guide you through application process I don't recommend last minute crash courses. Mathematics is taought layer by layer and there are no shortcuts. I will help you understand what mathematics is really about, help you become creative and come up with outside of box thinking over longer period of time and develop mathematical skills that will become very usefull whether you decide to pursue mathematical olympiads, mathematical degree or any other STEM degree.

# About me.

Having completed my undergraduate math course at University of Cambridge I was offered to stay and study for Masters in Mathematics (Part III) and I have been through the journey described here on my website.

I have taken part in many Polish Math Olympiads and was awarded a Laurate numerous times. As a reward, I was given the opportunity to represent Poland in International Mathematics Competitions in St Petersburg, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Vietnam. My research project [link here] took part in the EUCYS competition and won gold medal at the Polish Delta competitions. I took part in PROMYS Oxford in 2019 and PROMYS Bridge Boston 2020, as well as Math Beyond Limit Camp 2018 and 2019.

During my undergraduate degree, I did two summer projects in Graph Theory (2022) and Logic-Finite Model Theory (2023). During my Masters course I will be specializing in Logic and Set Theory, which are universal subjects for all Pure Mathematicians and my plan is to undertake a PhD in that field.

I have got a lot of experience in teaching and explaining mathematics. As a highschool student I conducted extracurricular classes in my middle school and I was the cofounder and lead of the (Polish) Internet Math Junior Olimpiad Club where I coauthored elaborations, selected problems, proofread, graded and worked on a 300 page long book summarizing our work. I thought and tutored students in one-to-one format both those younger to me and those my age. I lectured course in projective geometry as a Semi-Tutor at Maths Beyond camp.

But that journey would not be possible for me without the support I received from my parents and my maths teachers and tutors. When I was in primary school my school teacher noticed my interest in maths and suggested my parents sign me up for extra math lessons with a private tutor, which they did. I went to the top middle school in Poland which primarly focused on Olympiad preperations and during that time I was working with another private tutor who specialised in Olympiad preparation. I then progressed to a math highschool after which I applied to Cambridge. Having started my math journey so early allowed me to pass the admissions and entry exams (STEP) with ease.
