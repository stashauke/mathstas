# About Me [TEST 8/25/2023/9/55 test]

I am a Part III student studying for Masters in Mathematics at Cambridge University and I have been through the journey described here on my website.

I have taken part in many Polish Math Olympiads and was awarded a Laurate numerous times. As a reward, I was given the opportunity to represent Poland in St Petersburg, Slovakia, and Vietnam. My research project [link here] took part in the EUCYS and Delta competitions, and I took part in PROMYS 2019 and PROMYS 2020, as well as MBL 2018 and MBL 2020.

During my undergraduate degree, I did two summer projects in Graph Theory (2022) and Logic-Finite Model Theory (2023).

This year, I will be specializing in Logic and Set Theory, which are universal subjects for all Pure Mathematicians and my plan is to undertake a PhD in that field.
