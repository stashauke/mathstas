# About me.
I am a part III masters of mathematics student at Cambridge University and I have been through the journey described above, I have taken part in Polish Math Olympiads and become a Laurate numerous times and as a reward I got the opportunity to represent Poland in St Petersburg, Slovakia and Vietnam. My research project [link here] took part in EUCYS and Delta, I took part in PROMYS 2019 and PROMYS 2020, as well as MBL 2018 and MBL 2020. During my undergraduate degree I have done summer projects in Graph Theory (2022) and Logic - Finite Model Theory (2023). This year I will be specializing in Logic and Set Theory which is universal for all pure mathematics with a prospect to undertake a PhD course in that field.
