# How will you be tought? How Can I help you?

I tutor highschool and middle school students interested in taking part in olympiad competitions and studying undergraduate mathematics or applying for STEM undergraduate degrees, whether it's physics, engineering or computer science, math will still be very important!

Since highschool I was preparing students for Junior Math Olympiads [thatâ€™s how it worked in my school back in Poland, I was tought by my older peers, to give back the favour, I would conduct extra classes for my younger peers] and through that journey I gathered a lot of study materials and a lot of materials have been also created. Some of the materials I have co-authored where sourced by the Olympiad Committee and published as official studying source.

Lesson consists of content lectured by me with theorem and ideas presented. Then I give carefully selected problem set with questions in that subject. The student then goes through the questions in his own time [most important part of learning!] and then we discuss their questions and solutions. Hints are available for questions and can be shared between lessons if needed.

Although I will help you with preparation for your entry exams and guide you through application process I don't specialise in the last minute crash courses. Instead I will help you understand what mathematics is really about, help you become creative and come up with outside of box thinking over longer period of time and develop mathematical skills that will become very usefull whether you decide to pursue mathematical olympiads, mathematical degree or any other STEM degree.
