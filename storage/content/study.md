# How to choose your University?

If you're a student who enjoys thinking analytically, you might be wondering which university course to choose. Should you go for Mathematics, Computer Science, Data Science, Physics, Engineering, Economics, or maybe Medicine? And which subjects in school should you pay more attention to?

One important thing that connects all of these courses is the use of mathematics. Understanding math is crucial for each of these fields. However, what sets these courses apart is the balance between theory and practice, as well as the opportunities for jobs in academics or industries after you graduate.

There's a common misunderstanding that if you graduate with a degree in mathematics, your only job option is becoming a math teacher. But in today's world of Machine Learning and Data, companies are competing hand over fist to recruit and employ math graduates. With instances of one of them getting banned from entering and advertising at the Cambridge Math Departament because they were offering incredibly well-paying job contracts to students who were only halfway through their degree.

Here's a straightforward piece of advice: if you can, focus on learning math well in school. This is because it's generally easier to learn the non-math parts of your chosen university course later on.

Other things you might want to consider when choosing your university are aspects such as: location, reputation and rankings, faculty and research, sports and study facilities, networking opportunities, extracurricular activities and societies and more.

# Application Process

- **Personal Statement**: A personal statement is a brief written document, typically 4000 characters, where applicants express their motivations, achievements, and aspirations. It highlights their suitability for the chosen course, demonstrating their enthusiasm and relevant qualities.

- **Letter of Reference**: A letter of reference is a supportive document written by a teacher, counselor, or professional who knows the applicant well. It assesses the student's abilities, character, and potential for university studies, offering an external perspective on their suitability.

- **Interview**: An interview is a conversational assessment where applicants engage in a discussion with university representatives. It aims to evaluate their academic interests, skills, and motivation. It's an opportunity for candidates to demonstrate their suitability for the chosen course.

# Entry exams

Some courses require applicant to sit entry exams, for example:

- **STEP Exam**: The Sixth Term Examination Paper (STEP) assesses advanced math skills similar to those at the undergraduate level. Recognized by universities like Cambridge, Warwick, and Imperial College and administered in June, it's required for some courses in pure and applied mathematics and optional for others. Since 2021, only STEP 2 and STEP 3 are available; STEP 1 is discontinued. The test includes two 3-hour exams, with candidates answering 6 out of 12 questions.

- **MAT Exam**: The Maths Admissions Test (MAT) is for Oxford University applicants pursuing Maths, Computer Science, or joint honours courses. It evaluates in-depth mathematical understanding at the A-level or equivalent stage. Held in October, MAT assists in shortlisting candidates for interviews, considering UCAS applications and backgrounds without a "pass" mark requirement.

- **SAT Exam**: The Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) is recognized by universities across the United States and internationally, serving as a common admissions benchmark. It consists of a 55-minute section with 38 questions where calculators are allowed and a 25-minute section with 20 questions where calculators are not allowed. The SAT is held on multiple dates throughout the year, offering flexibility. 

- **TMUA Exam**: The Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA) is used by certain UK universities for courses including Computer Science and Economics. Taken in October it's a 2-hour exam evaluating school-learned math and mathematical thinking.

# Guidance

This process might be overwelming at first so it's good not to be alone when applying. If your friends and peers are applying you can help each other by for example making sure nobody missess a deadline. If some of your friends are already studying at the uni of your choice, then they would be a good point of contact. Your teachers at school and parents should also be of great support. However if you would like even more guidance you can resort to:

- **Project access** is a non-profit organisation helping pairing highschool students aplications with university students to create pairs mentor-mentee to help applicants.

- You can also consult a **private tutor**, I am also able and happy to guide you through that process.
