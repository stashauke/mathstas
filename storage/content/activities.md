# Olympiads

You have to stretch you mathematical out-side of the box thinking, as questions are no longer closed form. You need to write down your proof which usually is an abstract proof, which may be intimidating at the beginning but highly addictive after a while. If you are lucky, your country is offering a Junior Olympiad, if not, you will have to enter start with Senior Olympiad and the effort might be rewarded with you representing your country on at an international Olympiad

Winning medals at the IMO is a remarkable achievement that highlights outstanding mathematical prowess and can open doors to future academic and professional opportunities.

# Research projects

Here you can unleash your true unlimited creativity, a paper has to be written on a subject not studied before, not only do you have to solve a hard problem, but you have to find one first! Once accepted a poster or a presentation will be necessary for the finals.

- The **European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS)** is an esteemed annual competition that gathers young scientists from across Europe to showcase their innovative research projects. Aimed at students aged 14 to 20, EUCYS provides a platform for participants to present their scientific work to a panel of expert judges and the public. The competition covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, from biology and physics to engineering and mathematics. EUCYS aims to foster creativity, collaboration, and scientific inquiry among young individuals while recognizing outstanding achievements and promoting a passion for science.

- The **Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)** is a premier global science competition for high school students. It offers a platform for young scientists to present their innovative research projects spanning various scientific disciplines. Participants from around the world showcase their work, engage with experts, and compete for awards and scholarships. ISEF fosters scientific inquiry, collaboration, and creativity, nurturing the next generation of scientists and innovators.

# Camps

If that’s not enough for you and you want to spend your summer doing maths, apply for one of those. You will get to meet peers as excited about maths as you from other countries, probably some big-fish fields awarded mathematician or top professor in a given field will be around to give a guest lecture. Math matches (it’s more fun than it sounds, trust me!), year long undergraduate course lectured in four hours, proof of a problem that remained opened for 300 years presented on a t-shirt, countless lectures and problem sets inspiring you to study maths and that’s not everything. Non-maths activities can include but are not limited to day trips, puzzle hunts, sports: frisbee, football, volleyball, you name it, hikes and more. You can also have your own lectures.
